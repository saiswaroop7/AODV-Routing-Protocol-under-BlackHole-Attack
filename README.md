# AODV-Routing-Protocol-under-BlackHole-Attack
An Ad-hoc network topology with 10 nodes is built and with addition of two malicious nodes and the Ad-hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) routing protocol is employed. We use and modify an existing wireless networksimulator in NS2 for the simulation tests. The simulation time is 100s.

In this simulation we use NS2 and have take ten mobile nodes including the two malicious infected nodes and measure the performance of AODV routing mechanism under the Black Holeattack.
